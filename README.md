This WordPress plugin detects Bible references when content is saved. If a reference is found, it wraps a link around that reference to that text on Bibles.org.

Current version has the bare minimum idea working. It can identify references to a single verse in the format book chapter:verse and add a link. 

Future plans:
- Identify other reference formats
- Link properly for all formats. Currently Bibles.org expects an end chapter and verse as well and I am not providing that. 
- Skip adding the link if there is already a link or header around the reference. 
- Add the rest of the possible abbreviations.
- Add support for more translations, with an option screen for the user.
- Provide a way for users to opt out of the auto-links on a per-post basis.
